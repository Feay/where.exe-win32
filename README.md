# where.exe-win32

the classic where command with better output plus interactive mode for win32 windows, 98 thru win10+ made with euphoria 3
Note that to my expierance win10 doesn't allow programs to make files in system32, and euphoria interpeter is shrouded around the script when making an exe with euphoria, does just that, so you should put this into the windows folder or anywhere that is in your path enviroment varabiles, as seen in control panel > system > adavanced > enviroment varables
